      <strong> Kristallnacht Analysis - Luke Graham</strong> 
      <div class="essay">
       
         <div class="paragraph">Kristallnacht was called the “night of the broken glass”. Many people targeted Jewish populations with the goal of forcing them out of Germany. Kristallnacht took place during the Holocaust. I believe that this night was called Kristallnacht (crystal night) because it was a night of disruption, with many acts of destruction/”broken glass”. Kristallnacht occurred on the night of November 10th, 1938 in Nazi Germany.
</div>
         <div class="paragraph">Contrary to the beliefs of many people, more people from Germany than Nazis took part in these attacks. Perpetrators included neighbors and other acquaintances of Jewish people who decided to partake in these attacks. The victims were Jewish people, who were simply living in their own communities only to be woken up by rocks and bricks. 
</div>
         <div class="paragraph">One difference I noticed with Gerd’s story, a Rabbi living in Germany on Kristallnacht, was that he was sent to prison himself due to his strong affiliation with Judaism. Luckily, he was set free eventually as long as he checked in with the Gestapo. I found Gerd’s story particularly interesting because he mentioned that his father lost citizenship in Russia, so he didn’t have a home state in which he could register in. Another difference I noticed was in Susan’s story. Her experience demonstrated collaboration and understanding between two people living during the difficult time of the Holocaust. Her father was found by an officer, and he agreed to turn himself in since the officer needed to show that he captured anyone to those above him. I found this interesting because it relates to the Nuremberg Trials; even though the officer was given orders whether they were right or wrong, he felt forced to comply and was too afraid to speak out against them. 
</div>
         <div class="paragraph">The takeaway message from the first video for me is that it is crucial to speak up before it is too late. If you decide not to speak up when you notice someone else being treated unfairly, you could become the victim. The takeaway message from the second video was that it is important to take all perspectives into consideration and be grateful for what you have. Gerd was lucky that he was not sent to a concentration camp, and he understands how lucky he is not to be one of the millions of people who were killed during the Holocaust. Sometimes we only understand our privilege when we lose it. The takeaway message from the third video was that relationships are more important in life than we may recognize. In her father’s example, his family believes that he was set free because he had a good relationship with the chief of police. It is difficult to understand how someone may help you in the future if they seem insignificant to you at the moment, but it is important to treat everyone with respect to not only show that you value them, but also to build a mutual relationship where they could help you in some way. 
</div>
         <div class="paragraph">I noticed that all three videos demonstrated the consequences of the bystander effect, the emotion that the victims were feeling, and the understanding that they needed to leave Germany. Each video demonstrated how the bystander effect affected the victims by explaining that even neighbors took part in the attacks and refused to side with the Jews for fear of being targeted as well. I felt emotional watching the videos based on the amount of emotion that the victims were expressing. The third victim, Susan T., was still grieving her father. Watching Susan become emotional while trying to recollect the events of that night was difficult for me to watch, but also shows me how personal and scary this night was for her. All three videos mentioned that the common understanding amongst Jewish people was that they needed to find a way out of the country. It amazes me that the non-Jewish population of Germany was able to force fear on so many people. 
</div>
         <div class="paragraph">I wonder how the people invading the Jewish homes knew what home they were invading. For example, one of the victims mentioned that they lived in a Jewish neighborhood, so the perpetrators went door to door invading homes. How did the perpetrators know that a house did not belong to a Nazi or even someone that is not Jewish? I wonder if their intentions were to scare the Jewish people to prevent them from speaking out against other Nazi actions, or to make them decide to leave the country completely. I also am curious about how those who caused property damage were charged. The video explained that the homeowners had to pay for all of the damages, but I wonder if any of the perpetrators were prosecuted separately. If not, this shows just how terrified the victims were of speaking out against the actions of the attackers.
</div>
         <div class="paragraph">I learned that people are uncomfortable speaking up when they are not the ones being affected. All three videos mentioned that they wish others would have used their voice to stop the attackers. I also learned that contrary to my own previous belief, it was not only Nazis that were targeting Jewish people. Many people believed the Nazi’s stereotypes of Jewish people and grew to hate them as well. I learned that hurtful and violent actions from a large group of people can affect many people; but this also solidifies my understanding of the fact that when many people do something positive or helpful, they can have a largely positive effect.  
	I believe that we can best combat hate and intolerance today by advocating for our beliefs when we see something that we know is not right. The bystander effect is a recurring problem throughout history and is often one of the sources of major historical issues. Although the bystanders in this scenario were not directly killing the Jewish people, they could have prevented it by speaking up, I believe that this also applies to current events. If we notice an act of injustice or intolerance in society, it is important that we speak out on the behalf of others before we become the victims. In modern society, speaking out is often seen in the form of public protests or awareness groups creating messaging to convince a specific group that something is unjust.
</div>
         <div class="paragraph">I felt disgusted yet amazed watching these videos. I understood how severe the Holocaust was, but I only truly realized today how much hatred there was towards Jewish people outside of concentration camps, and in their daily lives of Jewish people. In the videos, they mentioned that the goal of the non-Jewish people was to force the Jewish people out of the country. I am amazed by the fact that they were able to create a collective agreement amongst Jews that led to their only option being to flee Germany. 	</div>
