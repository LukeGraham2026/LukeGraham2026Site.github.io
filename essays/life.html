      <strong> Life is Beautiful Analysis - Luke Graham</strong> 
      <div class="essay">
       
         <div class="paragraph">Life is Beautiful was difficult to watch because the Holocaust is a heavy subject that is difficult to comprehend. Emotionally, I felt disgusted and appalled by the imagery I saw in certain scenes. For example, I looked around at my classmates when the movie displayed the pile of skeletons because I was so taken aback by the image. This movie was also upsetting, because so much time was spent setting up Guido’s character to be light-hearted, and then he was the one to die from the war. In my opinion, the most powerful scene of Life is Beautiful was when Joshua emerged from his hiding place on the street and found the U.S. soldier who took him to safety. This is the most powerful scene in Life is Beautiful because it maintains the game that Guido made up for Joshua because he believed that the prize for winning the “game” was a tank. This was also a very powerful scene because it is the first time that Joshua does not have Guido to protect him, and we know that he will not have his father in the years to come either. The most disturbing part of Life is Beautiful for me was when the pile of skeletons was revealed near the gate of the concentration camp. Guido and Joshua stumbled upon dozens of skeletons and Guido realized that he could be one of those who did not survive if he attempted to escape as well. This was disturbing for me because it directly displayed how many people had died in just one concentration camp. I feel that I learned a lot from this movie about not only the Holocaust but also the relationships that people can have and the ways that movie directors change different elements to change the tone of the movie. I understood how the director changed the costumes and backgrounds to darker scenes and made the music somber and sometimes chilling to reflect the events that were being displayed. Life is Beautiful taught me about how adults can attempt to alter a child’s reality to shelter them from their true situation. The saddest part of the movie for me to watch was when Joshua started to understand the truth about his situation. Joshua overheard another prisoner saying that they would be turned into buttons and soap, which is incomprehensible for an adult, let alone a young child. It was very upsetting to hear such a young child believe that he was going to be turned into something for profit, but Guido continued to play along with his act. The most hopeful part of the movie was when the U.S. soldier arrived in the tank to save Joshua. The fact that Joshua believed that the tank was his prize for winning the game exhibited his innocence. I was hopeful when I saw this because it demonstrated that Guido was successful in his mission to prevent Joshua from understanding the actual events of the Holocaust. Life is Beautiful connects to Maus and the Making History Alive presentations because they all explained the events of World War 2 in ways that were relevant and intriguing. Life is Beautiful uses a strong plot with well-developed characters to convey a stronger message about the Holocaust. Maus used the perspective of Vladek, Artie’s father, to describe the events of the Holocaust through memory. The MHA presentation used relevant forms of antisemitism and included discussions about debates today to start the conversation about the Holocaust. The two slides that I remember clearly were the slides about Kanye West’s anti-Semitic language in the past month, which started the conversation for our class about modern-day anti-semitism, as well as the slide that brought up the question of “Would it be okay for housing today to be built on the former grounds of a concentration camp?”. These slides were almost like a hook and transition of an essay, they started by catching our attention by referencing a public figure that many of us are familiar with and then transported us into the history of the Holocaust from our daily lives. The lessons that I learned from our Holocaust unit that will inform my actions in the future are to hold others accountable for their words and actions and to not expect that someone else will speak up for something if I choose not to. If everyone has the same bystander mentality, nobody will solve any problems by being an upstander. This inspires me to be an upstander rather than a bystander because it reminds me that if I notice something unjust, I can’t just ignore the situation by thinking that someone else will handle it. This unit will remind me that a large event in world history was caused by the bystander effect, and I need to take the small steps that I can in order to prevent mistreatment on a smaller scale. One problem in our school community that I would like to work on is the use of rude language and unnecessary comments. I am choosing this issue because it is manageable for me to correct among my friends and peers. If I notice a classmate say something rude or insulting to another classmate, I should remind them to be respectful to others (without doing so publicly, making matters worse). This corrects unnecessary behavior on a small scale that benefits our greater school community. If I were to not pay attention to this issue, small comments can continue to build up and harm someone emotionally, and I can’t expect that someone else will be there to comfort them. On a national scale, I could make sure to only purchase items from ethical companies. One common theme that I have noticed is that people realize that a company is using unethical practices to make a profit on their product, but then the conversation dies down about the company since many people would rather stick to the convenience of buying the product rather than trying to find a more ethical company that may be more expensive. This relates back to the bystander effect and reminds us that even though it is important to make changes on a personal level, only minuscule effects will be noticed if the majority of people do not change their ways. Globally, I believe that it is important to hold others accountable for the damage that they may be causing to the environment. We can do this on a small scale by reminding someone to pick up their trash from lunch or to recycle instead of throwing recyclable items into the trash. On a larger scale, we can vote for politicians who have made it clear that their goals are to create stricter regulations or to raise prices for harmful items in order to benefit the environment. The topic of climate change as a whole is important to me because we are already seeing the many effects of climate change and will continue to experience the negative consequences if we continue to harm the environment.
