      <strong>The United States Influence on German Eugenics - Luke Graham</strong> 
      <div class="essay">
       <div class="paragraph">From 1941 to 1945, the Nazi party led by Adolf Hitler had the goal of separating the Jewish people from German society as they were not viewed as having ideal characteristics. In Hitler’s mind, the perfect human was blonde-haired with blue eyes (mostly of Aryan descent), commonly seen among the German population. The Nazis were focused on dampening the rights of Jewish people in Europe and went to the extremes of killing around 6,000,000 European Jews because they did most of them did not display these features and were seen as impure. It is widely known that Jewish individuals faced torture including death and forced labor during the Holocaust. A not as well-known punishment used during the Holocaust was the practice of eugenics. Eugenics is the study of forcing or prohibiting the reproduction of individuals to obtain desirable traits in future human generations. The concepts of the Eugenics Movement were applied to the reproduction of the European-Jewish population in Germany. Since the Nazi party’s goal was to maintain the “pure” Aryan society in Germany, they were attracted to the study of eugenics which was popular in the United States, especially in California. Charles Davenport was a leader in the pro-Eugenics Movement in the United States and encouraged forced sterilizations to result in a healthier human race. The Eugenics Movement and eugenic practices in Germany during the Holocaust were directly caused by funding and research support from the United States.</div>
            <div class="paragraph">Eugenic laws have been considered unethical throughout history because they prevent people from exercising their basic freedom to have children. However, the United States pushed the Eugenics Movement with the hopes of improving the human race. Eugenic practices were performed mainly in California with about 20,000 incarcerated women having forced sterilizations between 1909 and 1979. This group was mostly made up of minority groups including Black, Latinx, and Indigenous women. Participation in crime was believed to be genetic, so those in prison often were prevented from reproducing due to their association with crime. Anyone believed to be “feebleminded” could be forced to have sterilization by the government. After people started to realize the danger of science, the increasing rate of sterilizations in California stopped after 1950 and only 84 sterilizations occurred after 1960. Undoubtedly, this shows a connection to intolerance because people were unable to make decisions for themselves, and the government was in total control of anyone’s ability to have children. Simply due to the racial origins of a person, their sex, and the fact that they were incarcerated, they couldn’t have the simple right to have children.</div>
            <div class="paragraph">Although this was a large issue in the United States, the practice of forced sterilization spread internationally. Eugenics isn’t always the prevention of reproduction through sterilization. Throughout history, immigration measures have been put in place to prevent certain groups of people with undesirable traits from immigrating. Germany noticed that the United States was enacting laws preventing immigration during the Warren G. Harding administration in 1921-23. They decided to use similar techniques by limiting immigration from Poland and encouraging immigration from Scandinavia. Germany was in the middle of the Holocaust when it started to use these eugenic practices against Jewish people living in Poland and within Germany. 
            <div class="paragraph">The United States had a large influence on eugenics in Germany. Influential and rich businessmen who already had a reputation in the U.S. were the “representatives” of the United States supporting Germany with its eugenics movement. Although this was the case and there is no doubt that hundreds of thousands of dollars of funding was provided to German eugenicists, the motives of wealthy people may not have been intentional in supporting such a negative movement. Germany had the motive to sterilize Jewish people to reduce their numbers in the country, so funding from the U.S. only encouraged them more. The reason that people from the United States spoke in favor of the Eugenics Movement was that they believed it was a revolutionary concept that would benefit humanity and they hoped to be credited for originally supporting it in the future. </div>
          <div class="paragraph">Eugenics has a direct connection to intolerance because it is a violation of human rights that limits the freedom of reproduction. Today we have laws to protect us from such a dangerous movement, but a topic that has come up frequently throughout United States history is the concept of limited government. The U.S. is based on the principles of limited government, so today it would be very controversial if the government could directly choose who was able to reproduce. In the eugenics Movement, the bystanders were led to believe by the country that eugenics was positive. The only people who would be considered bystanders looking back at the movement are those who knew that the situation was morally wrong and refused to speak up. Unfortunately, most people had the idea that eugenics was positive because the U.S. was pushing the message that eugenics would create a better society for our future. It was seen as a revolutionary science so many evil acts went under the radar. Those being targeted by eugenics had very little voice as prisoners compared to influential, famous people in the United States at this time. Most people were completely oblivious to the cons of the movement and thought it was a way to make the population healthier. </div>
           <div class="paragraph">John D. Rockefeller and John Harvey Kellogg, two influential businessmen in the United States used their foundations to directly fund the eugenics Movement. Although Kellogg and Rockefeller wanted to support the movement to seem like they were helping everyone, the underlying reason behind both of their donations was that they appreciated that the eugenics Movement discouraged the mixing of races. Like many people at the time, they were racist and close-minded when it came to the views of any minority groups who culturally were not similar to them. It was not until much later during the Civil Rights Movement that it was truly understood how much needed to change with racism, as white racial superiority was seen as normal in the 19th century. Support from these businessmen was not hidden from the public. The Rockefeller Foundation donated $410,000 (around $4,000,000 in today’s money) to German eugenic researchers. It was likely based on their views, Kellogg thought that mixing races would cause mental defects. </div>
          <div class="paragraph">Contributions to eugenics weren’t always in the form of large sums of money. Contributors to the movement in the United States included Charles Davenport who was a biologist and eugenicist. He spread these eugenic ideas as positive, causing citizens of the United States to believe that nothing was wrong when they heard about the movement. German and American eugenicists shared their discoveries and practices. From the National Library of Medicine, “American and German eugenicists were in close contact with each other, especially after World War I”...”[often] reporting on developments in eugenics in each other's countries”. Germany even borrowed pieces of laws created for U.S. states and combined them into the 1933 Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Defective Offspring in Germany. The Nazi regime practiced eugenics because they couldn’t prevent Jewish people from entering the country that were already citizens of. They wanted to find a way to limit the Jewish population within Germany. The way that Hitler and the Nazi government had found out about eugenics was because the concept was already on the rise in other parts of Europe and eugenics as a whole had been around for many years. They noticed that using restrictions, the government could control the makeup of its population for the future. Hitler and his leadership decided to apply the concept in a new way by using their hatred of the Jewish population to force sterilization upon them as another act of hatred that would result in a decrease of the Jewish population. A direct connection of the science shared between the United States and German Eugenicists is the fact that the Rockefeller Foundation provided support to both the Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes in Germany and the Ernst Rüdin's Institute for Psychiatry in Munich. Science was shared throughout the world in the form of “international meetings and publications”.</div>
            <div class="paragraph">Eugenic practices are important to study because they are a basic violation of human rights and it is important to understand how intolerance of certain groups was practiced in the past so it can be avoided in the future. Kellogg and Carnegie living in the United States did not understand the damage that they were causing by funding the Eugenics Movement. Their donations and funding supported the Eugenics Movement in Europe and caused many unneeded or wanted sterilizations. </div>
            <div class="paragraph">Unfortunately, modern forms of eugenics still exist today. Quotas and acts such as the Chinese Exclusion Act were seen in the history of the United States to “protect the economy”, although these were often based on racism and xenophobia. Although this isn’t always discrimination and some restrictions are needed for the economy, not allowing certain populations to mix is a form of modern eugenics. The definition of eugenics is “...the practice or advocacy of improving the human species by selectively mating people with specific desirable hereditary traits.” Preventing reproduction is a way to select the future population. At the same time, immigration restrictions are also an indirect form of eugenics because not allowing someone to immigrate to a country prevents them from raising children there, and consequently, those children won’t have more children, resulting in a homogeneous and unchanging population. Another modern example of suppression similar to Eugenics is the Roe vs. Wade decision planned to be overturned by the Supreme Court in 2022. Roe vs. Wade set the precedent for allowing women to have the choice of an abortion. Eugenics is similar to not allowing abortions because a body of higher power steps too much into the daily lives of those under it (a common theme seen with the development of the United States, limited government). Many people feel that the government is stepping way over the boundaries that are put in place by the United States Constitution, protecting citizens' privacy and choice. Other parties feel that by allowing the government to control such a fundamental aspect of life and rights, they are allowing society to develop positively in the future, an eerily similar concept to the now frowned upon Eugenics.</div>
