      <strong>Turtles All the Way Down Analysis - Luke Graham</strong> 
      <div class="essay">
      

        
          
        
            <div class="paragraph">According to statista.com, there were 49,410 authors in the United States in 2021. Many of these authors write to convey a belief or moral. An example of this is Turtles All the Way Down, a fictional novel written by John Green, an author and online video creator. Green wrote this novel to bring awareness to his struggles with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). His other works include award-winning novel The Fault in Our Stars and Looking for Alaska. Green uses a unique style of writing making the novel engaging with a casual tone that helps to introduce complex concepts. This novel is aimed at informing a younger generation about mental struggles by using informal language, a unique format, and a plot that is focused on the main character’s analysis of her life.
</div>
           <div class="paragraph">The use of texting between characters indicates that Turtles All the Way Down is intended for a younger audience. The protagonist's (Aza’s) texts are short and insignificant. For instance, Aza’s conversation with Davis was simple “Aza: ‘How’s the sky?’, Davis ‘Great. Huge. Amazing.’” (79). Davis’s phrase “Great. Huge. Amazing.” is also a metaphor that represents his life. He overlooks the fortune that his father has because he has grown up privileged but recognizes that it is great, huge, and amazing. Many younger readers have always used texting as a form of communication and having a text-like format allows for better comprehension. Green portrays the characters using abbreviations when texting, which only readers used to texting may understand. This made the novel more realistic because texting is a distinct form of communication that is used informally. I am used to messaging my friends to engage in conversation, and it would be unrealistic to have characters email or only talk in person as Green is telling a story that is taking place in recent years. </div>
           <div class="paragraph">In addition to using texting, he incorporated pop-culture references including Chuck-E-Cheese, Applebees, and Battlefront to portray that the characters were young and relatable. In Davis and Noah Pickett’s home, Aza notes that “To [her] left Noah Pickett [was] playing a space combat video game” (37). This gets the attention of readers who share this interest. Green used these references to make his novel relatable. Novels that I have had trouble relating to include Lord of the Flies and The Hate U Give due to the lack of modern concepts. The references to relevant topics allow Green’s novel to appeal to a broader audience.
</div>
           <div class="paragraph">Based on the first few pages of Turtles All the Way Down, I concluded that Aza was an overthinker and that the author would continue to showcase her obsessiveness by having her obsess over small things including her microbiome, a callus, and the cleanliness of her car named Harold. Green uses the rhetorical device of personification when he illustrates how Aza treats her car as a person with human traits who helps to transport her, not just a car. Aza’s continued self-analyses of her health affect her relationships. For instance, Aza was convinced that she had a Clostridium Difficile infection based on only a noise that her stomach was making. Green makes it clear that Aza is worrisome when she notes “I reminded myself that I didn’t have a fever, and my self replied: ‘You don’t have a fever YET’” (5). This caused Aza to be disengaged from the conversation that her friends were having, displaying how her OCD impacted her daily. 
</div>
           <div class="paragraph">Throughout the novel, Aza begins a relationship with her old friend Davis, whose rich father had disappeared after committing a white-collar crime. When Aza and Davis start to kiss, her OCD takes over. It becomes clear that Aza’s obsessiveness is holding her back in all parts of her life. She thinks “just kiss him…see if his microbes stay in you billions of people kiss and don’t die…he could be a nonsymptomatic E. coli carrier…boom dead in four days please fucking stop just kiss him JUST CHECK TO MAKE SURE” (153). Green uses a hyperbole to depict how Aza tries to convince herself that it is okay to kiss Davis. She exaggerates that “billions of people kiss” to help herself recognize how much kissing occurs and the likelihood that she would die from a kiss. Green used another visual writing technique, italics, to display the two different voices inside Aza’s head. The final phrase in all capital letters is Aza’s OCD, demonstrating that this side often takes control. This illustrates how Aza’s overthinking creates issues in multiple aspects of her life.
</div>
           <div class="paragraph">Turtles All the Way Down by John Green is an intelligently written book that uses a unique and modern style of storytelling. Green’s writing style makes his novel fluid and overall a successful story and uses storytelling based heavily on analysis making it an excellent example for other writers to follow. The casual tone, use of pop-culture references, and Green’s depictions of Aza’s OCD lead the reader into and bring attention to the serious mental disorders that many people deal with daily. Authors must continue to write about their personal beliefs and experiences because storytelling is how perspectives and knowledge are shared.
