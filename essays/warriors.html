                Warriors Don’t Cry is about the struggle of Black students attempting to integrate into White schools during the 1950s. The story begins by describing the dreams of the main character, Melba, to attend Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. Melba works with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to allow her and the other 8 Black students to integrate into Central High. With the help of the NAACP, the court ruled in favor of allowing the students to attend. Eventually, Melba and the other students integrating into Central High were ready to attend school. Unfortunately, there was poor security at the school and rowdy parents who were unhappy with the integration were present at the school each morning. Additionally, the teachers didn’t have much power over the students so the Arkansas National Guard and 101st troops were needed to protect the students throughout the school year. The levels of security varied throughout the school year leaving the students to defend themselves.

                I enjoyed the book because it explained many conflicts that I could have never imagined people would have to face. For example, students often threw sticks of dynamite and spilled ink on the new students. I enjoyed how the book didn’t seem as much of an autobiography as it did a fictional story. The plot was very fluid and there were significant events spread out that helped the story move along. For example, each day of school was told in order and the struggles that were faced that day. It made me want to keep reading to see what would happen next because the days would often vary in terms of the struggles the students faced. Another example is how Melba’s relationships change with other characters throughout the book. Melba eventually meets a White student named Link, who helps her get away from White students who want to hurt her. In turn, she helps him with his sick nanny. This relationship changes throughout the book because at first, Melba doesn’t even know who Link is. Eventually, she becomes somewhat comfortable with him but in the end, he gets frustrated with her because she refused to date him. I enjoyed learning about the characters and observing their development throughout the story.

                I believe that this book is targeted for anyone who is interested in the extremes people went to in order to keep people that were different from them out of their schools. Even knowing a bit about segregation before reading this book, I felt that I learned a lot about something that I couldn’t experience to the same extent today from the main character’s perspective so I feel this book would be good for anyone with any amount of knowledge about segregation. I think reading this book was a good fit for me because being new this year to LJCDS, I realized that others have faced a lot worse by simply wanting to go to a school with people that don’t look like them. It makes me appreciate the welcoming environment at LJCDS that I’ve experienced so far. It is interesting to me how even today, many people are not treated with the same amount of respect by others and it’s important to remember this history.
